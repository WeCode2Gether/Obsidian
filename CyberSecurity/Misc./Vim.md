**There are 3 different modes on Vim/NVim**:
1. [Command.] This is where you run commands. This is the default mode in which Vim starts up.
2. [Insert.] This is where you edit/insert text.
3. [Visual.] This is where you visually select a bunch of text so that you can run a command/operation only on that part of the text.
In command mode there are many stuff you can do and this is a small list of important commands:
	- [$] to jump to the end of a line
	- [dd] Delete current line and erase space between this line and the next
	- [D] Delete line so u can write something in the current line.
	- [x] Delete this certain letter/character
	- [0] To go to the start of a line.
	- [w] go to the start of the next word in the line.
	- [e] go to the end of the next word in the line.
	- [I (capital i) ] to enter insert mode from the start of a line.
	- [gg] go to line #1 but on the same position as the cursor.
	- [:%s/old/new/g] Search for/the word OLD in the document/Change it to NEW/(idk what g does)
